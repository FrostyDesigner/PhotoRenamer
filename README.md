# PhotoRenamer
An application that searches through photo metadata and renames the files based on that data.

User Interface

The application copies the photos from the source folder to the destination folder. However, during the copy, the application searches the metadata of the picture and renames the picture with the format of year-month-day-sequentual number instead of the standard "IMG-NNNN" default format.
